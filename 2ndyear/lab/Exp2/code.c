 * Question :
 * Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for the following operations on Strings
 * a. Read a main String (STR), a Pattern String (PAT) and a Replace String (REP)
 * b. Perform Pattern Matching Operation: Find and Replace all occurrences of PAT in STR with
 *    REP if PAT exists in STR. Report suitable messages in case PAT does not exist in STR
 * Support the program with functions for each of the above operations. Don't use Built-in
 * functions.
